I've learned in the last three days:

### Recursion
Recursion was a problem for me at first, but after a couple of exercises it started to make sense to me, it's not perfect yet, but I can understand it now.
```python
# Countdown recursion
def countdown(n):   # definition of a function with one parameter
    if n <= 0:      # condition for termination (to prevent an infinite loop)
        print("Done!")      # output after recursion is complete
        return      # return what the function should return
    print(n)
    countdown(n - 1)

countdown(5)
```

### List comprehension
I absolutely love this thing. The name of this concept scared me at first, but again - I absolutely love it. 
I find it much more readable, clearer and of course faster, well, just great.
```python
# Creates a new list with numbers from 0 to 20 * 10.
# No else statement
result = [number * 10 for number in range(0, 21) if number % 2 == 0]
print(result)
```
With `else` statement:
```python
odd = [(number * 10 if number % 2 == 0 else number * 30) for number in range(0, 21)]
print(odd)
```

### Functions map(), filter() and reduce()
Very useful functions, I've already used them a couple of times. Lambda is also very useful!
```python
# map()
numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(list(map(lambda number: number ** 2, numbers)))
```
```python
# filter()
numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)))
```
```python
# reduce()
# Must be imported
numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(reduce(lambda x,y: x + y, numbers))
```

### Decorators
I was as excited about this as I was about the list comprehension. Not that I'm using it on my mini projects right now, 
but in the future when I'm looking into some huge codebase, I can imagine this, or when I'm learning Django :)
```python
def more_hello(func):
    def wrapper(*args):
        for n in range(0, *args):
            func(n)
    return wrapper


@more_hello
def say_hello(n):
    print("Hello")

say_hello(10)
```

Okay, that's it for today ðŸ‘‹
