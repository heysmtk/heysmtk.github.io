I’d like to thank everyone I’ve met, who has helped me and continues to help me on my journey to becoming a programmer. Starting with my amazing wife, who has the patience and understanding to support me.

A big thanks also goes to [Honza Javorek](https://honzajavorek.cz/) and his fantastic [club - junior.guru](https://junior.guru/club/), which has been incredibly helpful in my transition into IT.

I hope I won’t let any of you down 🙏🏻
