### New blog
Hi everyone, with this post, I’d like to kick off my little blog about my journey into IT as a Python programmer.

**What I’ll be writing about most often:**

- TIL’s – Today I Learned
- Projects – What I’m working on and how it’s going
- Career – Experiences from interviews and more

And anything else that comes to mind that I’d like to share, I’ll just write about it here :-)
