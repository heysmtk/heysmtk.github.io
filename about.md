Hi, I’m Tomáš Smutek. I’m almost 30 years old, married, and a father of two beautiful children. I’ve decided to learn programming, focusing on [Python](https://www.python.org/) for web backend development. I’m learning on my own, mostly at night or whenever I have some extra time.

My goal is to master technologies like [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and other tools for building web backends.

On this small [blog](https://smtk.cz/archive/) of mine, I’ll occasionally share what I’ve learned or created—kind of like a dev blog.
