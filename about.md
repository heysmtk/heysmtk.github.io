Hi, I’m Tomáš Smutek. I’m almost 30 years old, married, and a father of two beautiful children. I’ve decided to learn programming, focusing on **iOS development**. I’m learning on my own, mostly at night or whenever I have some extra time.

My goal is to master **Swift, SwiftUI** and other tools for building iOS apps. I’d love to work as an **iOS developer** in a company while also creating my own side projects and apps.

On this small [blog](https://smtk.cz/archive/) of mine, I’ll occasionally share what I’ve learned or created—kind of like a dev blog.
